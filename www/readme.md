Hi Jet,

I hope you can accommodate me more on this.  Having a hard time.  It might be that I you have some settings there for jaydata that I need to configure here in my McBook.

Very sorry for the disturbances.  I know I can repay your kindness someday.

Walter


px_data.sql, this is my MySQL table.  my db name is ipadrbg, MySql root has no password.

index.html - you can start here.  click second item, will get json from get_server_px.php and save to Local DB.
	the two html programs uses java script.

	SHOW RESULTS extracts the px_data records and display, also in javascript.

These all works in McBook but when I build it in IPAD, nothing is displayed.  Of course my get_server_px.php is hosted in my web server when I run it on the IPad. program works fine, Ipad no display. No errors either.
